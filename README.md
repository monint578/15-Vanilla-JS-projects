# Vanilla-JS-projects
https://codepen.io/collection/DoQwjR

I wanted to keep pushing myself forward and continue learning Vanilla JavaScript. This collection contains a lot on single-purpose components that were fun to create and may be handy in the future. 
Mobile first design approach is in all these mini projects.
index.css containes default styles (:root) except 1 Color Flipper.
 
1. Color Flipper. On button click changes random background color. In gradient.html changes to gradient background color and containes two buttons.
